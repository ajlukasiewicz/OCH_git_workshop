# Open Coding Hour GitHub Workshop

Welcome to the Open Coding Hour GitHub workshop! 
Rachael Cox and Alex Lukasiewicz will be guiding you through the basics of using github. We will start by covering some common terms used in the git world and then walking through the process of intializing your own repository. 
We will also cover how to work on collaborative projects and demonstrate what happens when things go wrong.

## Why use git? 

There are tons of reasons why someone would use git, from [hosting a website](https://github.com/wilkelab/wilkelab.github.io) to [publishing a package](https://github.com/rachaelcox/diffprot) to [ensuring reproducibility](https://github.com/marcottelab/CoEVxIMP) of published results  

One of the main advantages to using git while developing your code is for **version control**
GitHub offers a robust Version Control System (VCS) called Git that tracks and maintains a history of changes to files, allowing you to tweak, break, improve, break again, and recover scripts without having to work on "myscript_v3_20210401.py" one day and v4 the next

## More reasons to use git (for bioinformaticians)

Collaborating on a project is made easier with the GitHub forking and branching system (which we will demonstrate later in the workshop)

## Important Vocabulary and Concepts 
Most defitions from [1](https://doi-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668)

**Branch**: A copy of the files in your main repository. Useful for developing new features while keeping your old code intact. Useful for all the reasons you would want a stable version preserved: fixing bugs, writing new functions, sandboxing, and collaborative changes.

**Clone**: Create a local copy of a repository on your personal computer. Does not maintain a connection to the repo you have cloned from.

**Commit**: Once changes have been implemented, commits are a snapshot of those changes made. Usually associated with some unique message that you can use to track your changes over time.

**Fork**: Copy of another GitHub repository to your own while maintaining a connection to the original repo. Changes made to the main repo can be **pulled** as they are updated. **Forking** allows for collaboration on projects as you can also push changes to be **merged** if allowed by the owner of the repo.

**Merge**: Update files by incorporating changes from your own **branches** or from **forked branches**

**Pull**: To retrieve changes from a remote repository to your local repository 

**Push**: To send changes from your local repository to your remote repository 

**Repository**: Directory containing all of your tracked files with associated version history. Also referred to as a repo.


## Setting up your first GitHub repo 

There are two ways to initialize a repo on GitHub:
1. From local to remote repo 
2. From remote repo to local
