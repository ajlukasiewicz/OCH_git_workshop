# Open Coding Hour GitHub Workshop

Welcome to the Open Coding Hour GitHub workshop! 
Rachael Cox and Alex Lukasiewicz will be guiding you through the basics of using github. We will start by covering some common terms used in the git world and then walking through the process of intializing your own repository. 
We will also cover how to work on collaborative projects and demonstrate what happens when things go wrong.
