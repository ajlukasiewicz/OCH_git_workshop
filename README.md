# Open Coding Hour GitHub Workshop

Welcome to the Open Coding Hour GitHub workshop! 
Rachael Cox and Alex Lukasiewicz will be guiding you through the basics of using github. We will start by covering some common terms used in the git world and then walking through the process of intializing your own repository. 
We will also cover how to work on collaborative projects and demonstrate what happens when things go wrong.

## Why use git? 

There are tons of reasons why someone would use git, from [hosting a website](https://github.com/wilkelab/wilkelab.github.io) to [publishing a package](https://github.com/rachaelcox/diffprot) to [ensuring reproducibility](https://github.com/marcottelab/CoEVxIMP) of published results  

One of the main advantages to using git while developing your code is for **version control**
Git offers a robust Version Control System (VCS) that tracks and maintains a history of changes to files, allowing you to tweak, break, improve, break again, and recover scripts without having to work on "myscript_v3_20210401.py" one day and v4 the next

## More reasons to use git (for bioinformaticians)

Collaborating on a project is made easier with the GitHub forking and branching system (which we will demonstrate later in the workshop) 

Using this effectively as source control (how the sausage is made) 

I. Setting up github
  Making an account
  What is a readme 
  making your first init 
  public or private 
  
II. Vocabulary (important definititons)
  Cloning Forking and the differences between
  branch
  repo
  etc 
  
III.
